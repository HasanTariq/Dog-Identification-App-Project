## Description
This project is the sixth project of Data Science Nanodegree provided by Udacity .
In this project, I will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app.  At the end of this project, my code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
Please refer to my blog post for a quick overview:
